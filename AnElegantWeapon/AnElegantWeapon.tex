\section{Background}

\subsection{Ord Mantell}

Ord Mantell is a planet located in the Bright Jewel system of the galaxy's Mid Rim that is the homeworld of the Mantellian Savrip species. In the waning days of the Galactic Republic, Ord Mantell City housed a base of operations for the Black Sun crime syndicate. It later came under control of the Galactic Empire and became home to an Imperial deepdock.

Ord Mantell is a spacer's paradise Seun dreis and smugglers are welcomed with open arms. Such a concoction of vice and criminality would seem to make the world ungovernable, and indeed Ord Mantell borders on the brink of lawlessness, but that's been the case since the planet's colonization by Corellians. Open markets sell almost anything and in seedy cantinas transport can be secured for illicit cargo. Nothing is truly illegal on Ord Mantell. The only tax that is levied is one to vote. For if anything rules Ord Mantell, it's the mighty credit.

This is not to say the streets of Worlport or Savoia are death traps. Cities and casinos contract private security firms for police duty, considering the safety of the millions of tourists who come each year on gambling holidays their main priority. 

The Empire permits Ord Mantell its veneer of independence, relying on blackmailing the planetary govemor rather than outright subjugation. Mantellanys, however, are seeing more and more imperial stormtroopers in their cities. Imperials fear that Ord Mantell may become a hideaway for pockets of the Rebellion, and they keep an eye on the planet with fleet maneuvers and a gradual build up of ground forces.

\subsection{Player Characters}

The players are a rising group of theives / guns for hire. They sometimes take jobs such as this one. Other times they work independently stealing expensive merchendise from rich, imperial, and rebel alike. Ord Mantell has proved an easy place to prey on tourists as long as they look out for local cantina security. The locals rarely have anything worth stealing, making this job unqiue.

Recommended player characters are Rice, Tala, Rida, and Zaalbacc.

\section{Introduction}

The players are being hired by a mysterious buyer to break into a local gang's secret hideout. The buyer has learned that the hideout exists behind the local droid shop, with access through the shop's back room. What the players don't know is that the "gang" is actually a small rebel cell. They are being paid to retrieve a small brown chest that should be located inside the hideout's council room. The buyer is offering 5,000 credits for the package. The buyer doesn't care how the players retrieve the package, as long as the actions can't be traced back to her. However, she is considerate to warn the players that a direct assult on the hideout would be unwise, since it is likely to contain a small army. She is, after all eager to obtain her prize. A failed attempt would probably result in an increase in the hideout's security.

\section{The First Act}

The players need to come up with a plan for entering the base without being immediately killed. There are plenty of ways to do this. If the players seem to be struggling, they might be approached by the street kid or find a rebel datapad (See the datapad of Yunn'sara).

\subsection{The Cantina}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{cantina}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{textbox}
    \put(-285,48){\parbox{95mm}{\raggedright\color{yellowish}
    The cantina is dirty, silent, and rather vacant. It's as if the casinos on Oda Mantell have sucked the excitment out of the rest of the planet. Most of the occupants appear to be locals. A couple of patrons are at the bar, and one sits at a pazak table in the corner. A Trandoshan soldier stands in at the back looking bored.

\end{center}

\subsubsection{The Bartender}

The bartender knows very little, but will readily give basic info about the regulars in the cantina.

    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{The Street Kid}

The street kid will knows about the hideout the players are looking to infaltrate. He doesn't know anything about the group that calls it home, but he does know that it can be accessed through a grate in the floor of the kitchen that leads to a sewer system. He's used it several times to steal food for himself.

    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Pazak Player}

The pazak player is just looking to play pazak and knows nothing. But he is willing to gamble with the players.

    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Spice Dealer}

The spice dealer will try anything to sell you some spice. If you buy spice or upon a successful average (\difficulty) charm or coercion check, he'll tell the player about the street kid. Two advantages \advantage\advantage or a triumph \triumph will result in being told that the tenant of Apartment B frequents the droid shop and supposedly the hideout.

    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Mercenary}

The mercenary is for hire, and might tip the odds in a frontal assult on the hideout, but the players cannot afford to hire him immediately. Gambling or "finding" credits will help the players afford him.

\subsection{The Apartments}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{apartmentA}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{textbox}
    \put(-285,48){\parbox{95mm}{\raggedright\color{yellowish}
    (Outside) The apartments are more dull than the cantina was, if that's possible. Flickering communication consoles glow at each doorway as a means of communicating with the tenant that is supposedly inside. \\
    (Inside) Inside the apartment is nothing more than a bed, a kitchenette, and a water closet in the corner.
    }}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Apartment A}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.6\textwidth}
    The doors to this apartment are locked. A successful average (\difficulty\difficulty) scullduggery check will open the door. Inside, a bag lies on the bed containing 3 thermal detonators and a datapad detailing the use and potential damage caused by these grenades.
\end{minipage}
\hfill

    }
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Apartment B}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.6\textwidth}
    The door to this apartment is unlocked. If the players don't knock or use the console on the outside of the door to speak with the tenant, add one setback (\setback) to the first check during a conversation with the tenant. 

    The tenant is actually an undercover rebel that frequents the hideout the players are trying to enter. He is unwilling to betray the rebels without passing a daunting (\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty) coercion check. He will, however, admit to being a rebel upon a successful deception or charm check if the players express interest in his cause.

    Once the players convince the rebel that they are interested in helping the cause, he will agree to bring them to the hideout if they help him first. He informs them of a bounty hunter hired to cripple the rebel cell by detonating thermal detonators in the rebel hideout. He says that stealing the bounty hunter's thermal detonators should delay him long enough to let the rebels prepare for another attack. If the players do this, he will take them to the leader of the rebel cell in the rebel hideout.
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth}
    \raisebox{-\height+1.7\baselineskip}{
        \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{datapad}
        \put(-128,130){\parbox{3cm}{\raggedright\color{yellowish}Update: The new security system is in place. If the alarm is triggered from the droid shop please report to the main hall.

    }
\end{minipage}
\linebreak

If the players attack the tenant, they will find on his person a map of the rebel hideout along with notes from the droid shop owner detailing the new alarm security system he's installed.

Note: If you are running low on time, you can have the rebel direct the players to the empty apartment A instead of apartment D. If the players are directed to apartment D, they may choose to steal the thermal detonators from apartment A instead. They can then trick the rebel into believing that they succefully completed his task with an easy (\difficulty) deception check.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Apartment C}

A normal citizen is in apartment C. He willingly tells the players about the tenants in each of the other apartments if asked.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Apartment A: A bounty hunter, but he's been gone for a few days.
    \item Apartment B: Aparently works in the droid shops, since he goes there for long hours almost daily. 
    \item Apartment D: Another bounty hunter that just arrived yesterday.
\end{itemize}

    \multicolumn{2}{|c}{Equipment:} & \multicolumn{4}{p{5cm}|}{None} \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Apartment D}

The final apartment is occupied by a bounty hunter. On her person are 3 thermal detonators along with a datapad detailing her current contract (See datapad from Apartment A). The datapad mentions that the hideout behind the droid shop houses rebels. Again, if the players barge in, add one setback (\setback) to the first check during conversation.

The bounty hunter is not pleased at being distrubed, and she is not ready to share details about her current assignment. She is actually quite threatening, upgrade the difficulty of any checks made against her in conversation by replacing a difficulty die \difficulty with a challenge die \challenge. Continue to upgrade the difficulty of the checks with each attempt. Two threats \threat\threat or a despair \despair will result in her attacking the players.

If the players manage to findout about her plan to attack the hideout, they also findout that the hideout houses a rebel cell. At this point, she doesn't want the player's help bombing the base, but she doesn't care what they do after she fullfills her contract. She's on her way to the hideout now.

If the players want to convince her to give them the thermal detonators, they will have to pass an appropriate check. Remove any challenge dice \challenge. If the players attempt a coercion check, use one challenge die \challenge.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{The Droid Shop}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth, angle=90]{droidshop}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{textbox}
    \put(-285,48){\parbox{95mm}{\raggedright\color{yellowish}
    The droid shop seems to provide more life and light than the rest of the street combined. It's bright sign lights the walkway. Inside are bins of droid parts, a protocol droid, two utility droids, and a computer console for browsing the inventory. At the back, a Bothan sits at a desk tinkering with spare parts. A door behind him is labeled 'Employees Only'.
    }}
\end{center}

Only the owner of the droid shop is here, but he does have a console at his desk to alert the rebels of suspicious activity. He is even less willing to talk about the hideout than the rebel in the apartment. He simply denies any suggestion that there is something unusual about his shop. 

The shop owner won't use force to keep the players out of the back of his shop that holds the entrance to the hideout, but he will make threats and quickly alert the rebel of your approach. He will alert the rebels of your presense during the first check you make against him in conversation or during his first turn in a combat round. If the rebels are alerted you are coming, every rebel in the base will be in the front room and the player will have setbacks on their initiative rolls.

More helpful to the players, there is a computer terminal in the droid shop that the players can use to browse inventory. The owner of the droid shop was not completely careful and left that console connected to the same network the rest of the rebel hideout is connected to. An average (\difficulty\difficulty) computer check will have the following effects.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \success The players are rewarded with a map of the hideout.
    \item \advantage The players also recieve information regarding the true nature of the hideout, that it functions as a rebel base.
    \item \advantage\advantage The players also are able to deactive the alarm system.
    \item \advantage\advantage\advantage or \triumph The player also gain access to security cameras in the base.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Sewer}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{sewer}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{textbox}
    \put(-285,48){\parbox{95mm}{\raggedright\color{yellowish}
    The grate in the alley leads down into a narrow dark sewer via a ladder with rusting metal rungs. Two narrow paths run along either side of a stream of dark foul smelling liquid. Similar ladders run up the wall of the tunnel periodically.
    }}
\end{center}

The sewer entrance remains hidden from the players unless one of them passes a hard (\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty) perception check in the street. If they manage to find their way into the sewer on their own, they won't know where each grate leads without passing an average (\difficulty\difficulty) perception check at each grate. Then all the characters get is a description of the room directly above them.

Also, the grates are noisy. The player that goes through the grate first has to pass an average (\difficulty\difficulty) stelth check to go unoticed by characters in the room above them or adjacent rooms. Add a setback \setback for every character in the room the players are trying to enter. Unless the characters roll two threats \threat\threat or a despair \despair they can quickly retreat to the sewer. This prevents the player from actually being seen, but the character who heard them will now remain in the room above them.

\section{The Second Act}

The second act begins when the players finally gain access to the rebel hideout.

\subsection{Aggressive Negotions}

A frontal assult on the rebel hideout will be difficult unless the players recruited the mercenary in the cantina or obtained some thermal detonators. If the players have to fight all the rebels at once, it will be near impossible on their own.

\subsection{A Diplomatic Solution}

The players may try to enter the base under the pretense that they are planning to aid the rebellion. This may even be true. The players will be taken to the council room with the rebel from the apartment, the rebel leader, and her bodyguard. Upgrade any deception checks with a challenge die \challenge since the rebels will attack if they feel threatened.

\subsection{The Backdoor}

If the players find their way into the hideout kitchen without being detected, they have to successfully navigate to the hideout's council room where their prize awaits.

\subsubsection{The Kitchen}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{kitchen}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{textbox}
    \put(-285,48){\parbox{95mm}{\raggedright\color{yellowish}
    The kitchen is messy and poorly kept. Cooking tools, knives, and other pieces of equipment litter every surface. The room has too doors, but not much else.
    }}
\end{center}

The kitchen is messy, but if any of the players pass a hard (\difficulty\difficulty\difficulty) perception check they will find a datapad (See the datapad of Yunn'sara). The datapad contains mostly recipes and lists of food, but it also contains a map to the base.

\subsubsection{The Main Hall}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{mainhall}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{textbox}
    \put(-285,48){\parbox{95mm}{\raggedright\color{yellowish}
    The main hall is more of a rec room. Chairs line the walls, and a pazak table sits in the corner. Three doors lead from the room. Armed rebel soldiers...
    }}
\end{center}

The main hall contains rebels equal to the number of players. Walking in on the rebels will trigger a fight unless the players pass a diseption check with setback \setback. Some have datapads with maps of the base. If the check is passed, the players will be taken to the council room.

    This room might be intended to be an armory, but it resembles more a broom closet. Much more than blaster pistols line the shelves. Brooms, computer spikes, and spare parts take up just as much room. A computer console sits in a corner.

The armory contains grenades, medpacs, and a computer console with access to the same information available via the droid shop.

\subsubsection{The Council Room}

    Some care seems to be put into keeping this room well kept. A large table fills the room covered with charts and letters. A banner painted with the symbol of the rebel alliance hangs from the wall. At the head of the table lies a computer terminal and a small wooden chest.

\end{center}

Once the players reach the council room they will find the rebel leader, Kom'sara, and her bodyguard, Ruto Dene, waiting. The leader will not be as eager to attack the intruders as the rebels in the main hall. She will instead try to recruit the players.

Note: If the players kill any other rebels during the game, the GM may choose to remove the option of being genuinely recruited by the rebel leader.

\section{The Third Act}

The third act begins when the players have access to the council room.

\subsection{Complete the Contract}

If the players succefully defeat the rebel leader and her bodyguard they easily find the chest. If the players open the chest they find a blue bladed lightsaber inside.

Returning to the cantina should be easy, and the buyer will hand over the 5,000 credits hapily after seeing the lightsaber. The players can try to demand more money if they want. Once the money changes hands, the game is over. 

\subsection{Aid the Rebellion}

If the players choose to aid the rebellion instead obtaining their prize, they will be offered 2,000 credits for taking care of the bounty hunter on their doorstep. If the players have already done this they will be rewarded with these credits. If there is time left in the session, the bounty hunter will be found in the droid shop preparing to enter the base. Claiming this prize money from the rebels ends the game.

\subsection{Claim the Prize}

Alternatively, after defeating the rebels and obtaining the lightsaber, some players may choose to keep the prize for themselves. An easy (\difficulty) underworld knowledge check will reveal that the players could probably sell the lightsaber for 10,000 credits to the right buyer. An easy (\difficulty) lore check would reinforce the fact that the lightsaber would be a very powerful weapon but only after propper training. If the players choose to keep the lightsaber after learning these facts the game ends.
